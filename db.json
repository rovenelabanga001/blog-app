      "title": "Getting Started with Vue 3",
      "body": "Vue 3 is a major evolution of the Vue.js framework. It introduces the Composition API, which provides a more flexible and powerful way to organize component logic. The Composition API allows developers to encapsulate logic into reusable functions, called composables, making large-scale applications easier to manage. In addition, Vue 3 boasts improved performance due to a rewritten virtual DOM and better tree-shaking capabilities. With native support for TypeScript and a smaller runtime footprint, Vue 3 is optimized for both performance and maintainability. This guide will walk you through creating your first app, setting up components, and using reactive data effectively. We'll also explore migration tips from Vue 2 to Vue 3, community tooling updates, and how Vue 3 plays with modern bundlers like Vite and Webpack.",

      "title": "Understanding Reactivity in Vue",
      "body": "Reactivity lies at the heart of Vue. In Vue 3, it's implemented using JavaScript Proxies, which allow Vue to intercept and track changes to data properties. This enables efficient updates to the DOM when reactive data changes. The `ref()` and `reactive()` functions are core to creating reactive references and objects. Developers can also use `computed()` for derived state and `watch()` for side effects. Understanding these tools is essential for building dynamic UIs. The best way to grasp Vue reactivity is by building small examples and observing how Vue tracks and updates data in real time. We'll explore edge cases, performance tips, and how to integrate reactivity into complex component trees.",

With Vue Router, you can map routes to components, create nested routes, use navigation guards, and pass parameters or query strings between pages. Lazy-loading components via route-level code splitting helps improve performance. Vue Router also supports named views and programmatic navigation using `router.push`, `router.replace`, and `router.back`. This article walks through setting up a basic router, defining routes in a separate file, linking between pages with `<router-link>`, and handling navigation dynamically. We'll also troubleshoot common routing issues and best practices for route design in large applications.",

You can use `v-model` on input fields, textareas, checkboxes, radio buttons, and even select dropdowns. Under the hood, `v-model` is syntactic sugar for setting a value and listening to input events. For custom components, you can create a custom `v-model` binding using `modelValue` and `@update:modelValue`. This article also covers form validation using native constraints and third-party libraries like Vuelidate or vee-validate, as well as managing form submission via the `@submit.prevent` directive. We'll look at advanced validation strategies, dynamic forms, and accessibility tips.",

Lifecycle hooks such as `onMounted`, `onUpdated`, and `onUnmounted` replace the old `mounted`, `updated`, and `destroyed` options in the Composition API. Other hooks like `onBeforeMount`, `onBeforeUpdate`, and `onBeforeUnmount` are useful for debugging and setup. This post provides real-world use cases and explains how to clean up side effects properly using `onUnmounted` to prevent memory leaks in your application. We'll also explore common anti-patterns and how to use lifecycle hooks with Vue transitions and third-party libraries.",

This setup is ideal for creating MVPs or frontend-only apps with realistic data interactions. We'll also show how to use JSON Server's watch mode, add delay simulation for loading states, and use custom routes for filtered responses.",

This article explores best practices for managing component styles, including dynamic classes, conditional styles with `:class` and `:style`, and using preprocessors like Sass. A section is dedicated to handling dark mode and media queries within components. You'll also learn how to extract and reuse styles with layout components and themes.",

For parent-child, `props` and `emits` are sufficient. For deeply nested components, `provide/inject` can simplify passing values. This guide compares different patterns with real-life examples. It also includes tips on avoiding prop drilling, properly validating props, and using composables to share logic. Youâ€™ll also see how to create custom hooks to centralize logic and improve maintainability. We wrap up with guidelines for scalable architectures and avoiding tight coupling between components.",
