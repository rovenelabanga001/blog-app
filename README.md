# Blog Application

This is a frontend-only blog web application built using Vue.js for the user interface and JSON-server as a lightweight mock backend. The application allows users to browse, create, edit, and delete blog posts, simulating the behavior of a fully functional blog platform without requiring a real backend service.

By leveraging Vue.js, the project takes advantage of reactive data binding, component-based architecture, and efficient state management to provide a smooth, dynamic user experience. The JSON-server acts as a local RESTful API, serving mock blog data and handling basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for development and testing purposes.

## Features

- User authentication
- Displaying a list of blog posts with titles, content previews, and publication dates
- Viewing individual blog post details on a dedicated page
- Creating new blog posts with a user-friendly form
- Editing and deleting existing posts
- Creating new comments on other blogs
- Deleting individual comments
- Live updates without page reloads using Vueâ€™s reactivity system
- A fully mocked API powered by JSON-server for quick local development
